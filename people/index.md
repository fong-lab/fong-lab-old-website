  headline="Yichao Zhao, Graduate Student"
  text="Yichao Zhao is a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Graduate Program and the Computational Neural Engineering Training Program at Georgia Tech and Emory.  He received his dual BS degree in Biology and Biomedical Engineering from Emory and Georgia Tech. As an undergraduate he conducted research in cancer genetics and animal biomechanics, and subsequently worked as a flow cytometry specialist at Raybiotech.  Chao returns to GT-Emory with an interest in exploring computational methods in biomedical research.  His research leverages electrophysiology, computational modeling, and control system engineering tools to study neuroplasticity in visual circuits."

  headline="Ta'Kayla Wright, Undergraduate Student"
  text="Ta’Kayla is an undergraduate neuroscience major and a NIH ESTEEMED Scholar at Georgia Tech.  She is originally from Dublin, GA, where she contributed to her community through volunteerism with local blood donation and environmental groups, as well as through leadership roles on her high school student council and her city’s youth council.  At Georgia Tech, Ta'Kayla is studying neuroscience with the goal of attending medical school to earn her Au. D in audiology. She aspires to work as an audiologist in the near future, and possibly open her own clinic.  In the Fong lab, Ta’Kayla investigates homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in visual cortical circuits that accompany recovery from amblyopia."
