  headline="Yichao Zhao, Graduate Student"
  text="Yichao Zhao received his dual B.S degree in Biology and Biomedical Engineering from Emory and Georgia Tech. During his undergraduate years at Emory, he conducted cancer genetics research at the Winship Cancer Institute for three years. After completing his curriculum at Emory, he continued to pursue his engineering degree at Georgia Tech. He worked at Dr. David Hu’s lab of Biolocomotion and studied the motion of elephant trunks to develop soft robotic arms. After completing his undergraduate degrees in 2018, he worked in an antibody-based testing kit development team at Raybiotech. As a flow cytometry specialist, he collaborated with several computational biologists in the company, and this experience inspired him to explore the application of computational methods in biomedical research. Currently, he is a BME PhD student in Dr. Ming-fai Fong’s lab. His research interest is to use electrophysiology, computational modeling, and control system engineering tools to understand the development of neuroplasticity in visual circuits."
