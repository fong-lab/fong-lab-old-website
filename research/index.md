{% capture text %}
Visual deprivation is a classic paradigm for studying how acute disruptions to sensory experience can drive long-term plasticity in the brain.  We investigate how the quality of visual experience differentially impacts activity statistics in the visual thalamus and cortex, as well as the causal influence of these altered activity statistics on long-term plasticity.
