The central goal of the Fong Lab is to develop plasticity-based interventions for treating neurological disorders.

Visual deprivation is a classic paradigm for studying how acute disruptions to sensory experience can drive long-term plasticity in the brain.  We investigate how the quality of visual experience differentially impacts activity statistics in the visual thalamus and cortex.  We also develop tools to explicitly test the causal influence of these altered activity statistics on long-term plasticity.

Variability in ongoing neural activity influences the capacity for neural circuits to undergo plasticity.  This can fundamentally limit plasticity potential in mature systems or states of disease.  We seek to develop neural interfaces and control architectures for precisely regulating neural activity to create conditions that are permissive for plasticity.

Amblyopia is a widespread neurodevelopmental visual impairment that arises from maladaptive plasticity during infancy or early childhood.  We aim to develop novel therapeutics for amblyopia that leverage our knowledge of plasticity at different ages and disease severities.  Treatment strategies range from neuroprosthetic implants that directly stimulate the brain to minimally invasive manipulations to visual experience or behavior.
