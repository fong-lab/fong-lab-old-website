The central goal of the Fong Lab is to develop plasticity-based interventions for treating neurological disorders.

Visual deprivation is a classic paradigm for studying how acute disruptions to sensory experience can drive long-term plasticity in the brain.  We investigate how the quality of visual experience differentially impacts activity statistics in the visual thalamus and cortex.  We also develop tools to explicitly test the causal influence of these altered activity statistics on long-term plasticity.

Amblyopia is a widespread neurodevelopmental visual impairment that arises from maladaptive plasticity during infancy or early childhood.  We aim to develop novel therapeutics for amblyopia that leverage our knowledge of plasticity in neural circuits underlying vision.  Treatment strategies range from neuroprosthetic implants that directly stimulate the brain to minimally invasive manipulations to visual experience or environment.
