The Fong Lab seeks to understand how activity and experience shape neural circuits, and to develop plasticity-based interventions for treating neurological disorders.  Toward this goal, we use a variety of approaches including electrophysiology, optogenetics, behavioral assessments, computational modeling, and control systems engineering.  Current work focuses on the early visual pathway and neurodevelopmental visual impairment.

Visual deprivation is a classic paradigm for studying how transiet disruptions to sensory experience can drive long-term plasticity in the brain.  We investigate how the quality of visual experience differentially impacts activity statistics in the visual thalamus and cortex.  We also design tools to probe causal relationships between altered activity statistics on long-term plasticity.

Variability in ongoing neural activity influences the capacity for neural circuits to undergo plasticity.  This can fundamentally limit plasticity potential in mature systems or in states of disease.  We develop neural interfaces and control architectures for precisely regulating neural activity to create conditions that promote plasticity at the cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.

Amblyopia is a widespread neurodevelopmental visual impairment that arises from maladaptive plasticity during infancy or early childhood.  We aim to develop novel therapeutics for amblyopia that leverage our knowledge of plasticity at different ages and disease severities.  Treatment strategies range from neuroprosthetic implants that directly stimulate the brain to minimally invasive manipulations to visual experience or behavior.
