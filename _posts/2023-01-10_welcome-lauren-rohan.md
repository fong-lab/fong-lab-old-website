Two new undergraduates have joined the lab! [Lauren Wilson](https://fong-lab.github.io/members/lauren-wilson.html) is a junior at Georgia Tech majoring in biomedical engineering and minoring in industrial design.  [Rohan Raman](https://fong-lab.github.io/members/rohan-raman.html) is a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and minoring in computing and intelligence.  We recruited them to help to advance our mechanical instrumentation and mouse brain histology efforts, and we are thrilled that they have joined.  Welcome, Lauren and Rohan!
