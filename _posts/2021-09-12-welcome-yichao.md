Yichao Zhao has joined the lab!  Chao is a first-year PhD student in the GT-Emory BME program, with a background in previous research experience in cancer genetics and biomechanics.  He is interested in computational biology, and we have convinced him to apply that interest to neuroscience and visual plasticity.  Welcome, Chao!
