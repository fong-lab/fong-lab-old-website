Our friends at Open Ephys have been awarded a Direct-to-Phase-II SBIR grant from the NINDS and the NIH Brain Initiative to support a collaborative project with our lab.  We look forward to using their next-generation electrophysiology and behavior system to study visually-guided behavior in freely-moving, unencumbered rodents.
