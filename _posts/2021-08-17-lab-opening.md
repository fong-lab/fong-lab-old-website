# Hello world

Welcome to the Fong Lab! We study neural plasticity and how it can be leveraged to treat neurological disorders. The lab will open in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech & Emory in October 2021. The lab space is currently being renovated and populated with surgical suites, electrophysiology rigs, and more!
