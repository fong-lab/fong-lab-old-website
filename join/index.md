## Postdoctoral scholars
We anticipate funding for various postdoctoral opportunities to be available on a rolling basis throughout 2022.  Individuals interested working in the visual plasticity or closed-loop optogenetics space should contact [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu) about the most updated information on available positions.

## Research Technician
We are actively recruiting a a research technician to help advance our studies on neural plasticity and visual rehabilitation in mice.  The technician will be responsible for conducting experimental and analytical work, as well as managing laboratory operations.  Research activities may include (but is not limited to) mouse handling, stereotaxic surgery, ocular manipulations, electrophysiology, optogenetics, computational analyses, euthanasia, and histology.  Operational work may include (but is not limited to) ordering supplies, managing mouse colonies, setting up equipment, maintaining websites, organizing data repositories, updating animal/safety protocols, and contributing to a positive and inclusive laboratory environment.  The technician will also participate in weekly lab meetings and individual meetings with the principal investigator.

The candidate should have a bachelor's degree in engineering or science by the time of employment, OR an equivalent combination of experience and training.  Programming skills and/or experience working with rodents are preferred but not required.  Ideal candidates will be organized, detail-oriented, and committed to learning beyond of oneâ€™s area of expertise.
