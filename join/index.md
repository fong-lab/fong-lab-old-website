# Open Positions

We are actively recruiting **two undergraduate students** to join our team in Spring 2023 for research credit.

_Position #1: Research Assistant specializing in Histology_
The undergraduate researcher will be responsible for processing and analyzing post-mortem tissue harvested from the mouse brain and eye.  The individual will learn brain and eye anatomy, sectioning approaches, staining and immunohistological procedures, and microscopy.  The ideal candidate would be comfortable with bench work, able to handle very fragile specimens, and have a strong attention to detail.

_Position #2: Research Assistant specializing in Instrumentation_
The undergraduate researcher will be responsible for building rigs for use during mouse surgical and recording procedures.  The individual will be expected to apply principles of user-centered design to create accessible end-products for research use.  The ideal candidate would have knowledge of CAD, experience using machine shop tools, and the ability to work creatively and independently.

For both positions, undergraduate researchers would be expected to:
-	engage intellectually in the research topics of the lab
-	attend weekly lab meetings (unless conflicts with course schedule)
-	attend weekly one-on-one meetings with their supervisor
-	commit 10 hours per week to lab work
-	complete all required online trainings prior to the start of the semester
-	engage in lab communications in a timely fashion
-	assist with general lab tasks such as fabricating electrodes, making solutions, and tidying common spaces

For individuals interested in working in the lab for multiple semesters, there will be opportunity for research activities to broaden in future semesters according to student interests and lab needs.  Such activities may include electrophysiological recordings, behavioral testing, and small animal surgery.

If you are interested in applying for one of the open positions, please send an email to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu), formatted according to the following instructions:
-	Subject: *Undergraduate position – Histology* -or- *Undergraduate position – Instrumentation* (depending on which position you are applying for)
-	Body: Please write a statement of interest letter that includes: (1) a brief introduction, (2) why you are interested in our lab’s research, (3) why you are specifically interested in / qualified for the position, and (4) available times for a potential interview between December 7-14, 2022.
-	Attachments: resume or CV (max 2 pages)

note: If you are applying for both positions, send separate emails and tailor your email to the specific position.  Applying to one vs two positions will have no bearing on how you are evaluated.

We will accept applications until December 4, 2022.  We will review applications on December 5th and 6th, and invite a subset of applicants to interview between December 7th and 14th.  We aim to extend offers no later than December 15, 2022.

### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for various postdoctoral opportunities is available on a rolling basis.  Current funding is available for projects related to visual plasticity and optogenetic feedback control.  If you are interested our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

### Graduate students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 

[Georgia Tech and Emory Joint Biomedical Engineering Program](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/georgia-tech-emory-bme-phd-program) <br>
[Emory Neuroscience Program](https://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/NS/) <br>
[Georgia Tech Bioengineering Program](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/)

If you are interested in our lab's work, we encourage you to apply to one (or more) of the programs above.  On your application, you can list our lab as one that interests you.  If you are invited for an interview, please reach out and we will try our best to be placed on your interview schedule.  If you are offered admission and interested in learning more about joining the lab for your PhD studies or a research rotation, please contact [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

### Undergraduate students

# Informal Mentorship

Mentorship can come in many forms, and you do not need to be a member of the Fong lab or interested in our research to seek support.  Ming-fai is open to chatting with students and postdocs on a range of topics (e.g. choosing a lab, career advice, imposter's syndrome, sexual harassment, responsible conduct of research, forming a thesis committee, etc).  Feel free to get in touch with Ming-fai if you would like to talk.
