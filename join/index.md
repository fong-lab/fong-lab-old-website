# Open Positions

### Research Technician
We are actively recruiting a research technician to help advance our studies on neural plasticity and visual rehabilitation in mice.  The technician will be responsible for conducting experimental and analytical work, as well as managing laboratory operations.  Research activities may include (but is not limited to) mouse handling, stereotaxic surgery, ocular manipulations, electrophysiology, optogenetics, computational analyses, euthanasia, and histology.  Operational work may include (but is not limited to) ordering supplies, managing mouse colonies, setting up equipment, maintaining websites, organizing data repositories, updating animal/safety protocols, and contributing to a positive and inclusive laboratory environment.  The technician will also participate in weekly lab meetings and individual meetings with the principal investigator.

The candidate should have a bachelor's degree in engineering or science by the time of employment, OR an equivalent combination of experience and training.  Programming skills and/or experience working with rodents are preferred but not required.  Ideal candidates will be organized, detail-oriented, and committed to learning beyond of oneâ€™s area of expertise.  The position is for full-time employment on the Georgia Tech campus, with a minimum commitment of 1 year.

Applicants should submit a resume/CV (maximum of 2 pages), letter of interest (maximum of 1 page), and contact information for 2-3 references to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

# Informal Mentorship

Mentorship can come in many forms, and you do not need to be a member of the Fong lab or interested in our research to seek support.  Ming-fai is open to chatting with students and postdocs on a range of topics (e.g. choosing a lab, career advice, imposter's syndrome, sexual harassment, responsible conduct of research, forming a thesis committee, etc).  Feel free to get in touch with Ming-fai if you would like to talk.
